Peer Review - By Michael Sawchuk

Cole Sawyer
Preparation: Came prepared when it was time for us to work. Often worked ahead.

Contribution: I couldn't have done the project without him. Many of the complicated
parts of the final code are things he figured out and added.

Respect: We had very productive brainstorming sessions in which we each offered
our own ideas and discussed their viability. Both of our ideas were considered
with respect.

Flexibility: Our schedules worked very well together even if we worked a lot
at the last minute. Cole knew that the project had to get done and set his schedule
accordingly to accomplish that.


Self-Assessment
Preparation: Before we met I felt like I generally was prepared for our work sessions
with research and work. Even if the research I did often ended up being less relevant 
than I expected, I still learned from my mistakes.

Contribution: Overall we did a good job working with each other's strengths, and so
I believe that both him and I had solid contributions. For example, at the end there
were a few parts I did not understand as well as him, and so I did most of our write-up
while he worked on those parts, while at other times I was writing code while he thought
of improvements to the algoritms. This type of strategy allowed each of us to focus on
what we could do most effectively at that moment.

Respect: I always encouraged and valued Cole's ideas, as I appreciated any help I could
get with thinking of solutions to our problems.

Flexibility: Although there may have been a couple times I was busy, I was there when it
counted and we had little to no problems finding time to work on the project.
