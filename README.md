"# DataVisFinalProject" Note: We created two branches of the project. Each one is demonstrating the visualization on a different dataset. The default is the college major data, and the second one is about financial data.
Note that due to the randomness of d3 force simulations, the financial data branch(master) may not configure the first time you run it. If it gets stuck in a loop or the contour is wrong, run it again and it should be correct.

To run, just set up a python server with 'python -m http.server' and navigate to http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser
